This might be surprising to many but before today I never knew about such an life saving tool, the "Tab Suspender". 

I have this problem or can say, a work habbit to open tones of tabs and not closing them for forever. I open them once and close them never. 
This maybe due to the fact that I never know when I will need them again or maybe due to the fact that I am just lazzzy. 

But I have been thinking of ways to reduce the amount of impact the tabs have on my device. Though it can easily handle 100s of tabs simultaneously but what about when I need to run something heavy? I might need more of RAM. 
So I have always wanted a way kinda kill them yet keep them type of tool for tab. But stupidly, it never came across my mind that there can be a tool like that already.

This comes as an browser extension from the web store. This can do magic and gives you so much freedom!

I am so happy after finding this wonderful tool.
