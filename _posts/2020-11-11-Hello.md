### Welcome Visitors! 

I am Aman Kumar (amanasci). I created Asci Labs for fun and sharing my thoughts and knowledge with you all. This place won't be as much organised as you are expecting it to be. You won't know what you'll be reading after you press that next button down below ( Even I don't know what I'll be writing next ). 

As I said, it's all random. Just like the beautiful digits of Pi ($\pi$) .

Randomness is beautiful and more attractive than anything else.

**What?**

*You don't believe me?*

OK! Just go and appreciate these videos I loved, and discover how $\pi$ is hidden in random things. 

Talk to you in the next post.
