Hello everyone. I am Go-ing.

Not leaving this blog or world. I just started using the Go programming language. 

I was a python and Java user form a long time and was using them for most of my projects as you can see on my github [profile](https://github.com/amanasci). Most of the projects I used to work on were either data science or Android App Development projects, so Python and Java were just perfect for my work. 

But recently I got into the mood to write a neural network from scratch. And from scratch, I literally mean scratch. Everything from basics. Creating neural network, writing the maths,etc everything from the very begining. **Without any use of external libraries**

### Yes!

I'll even write those mathematical libraries for linear algebra and calculus part involved.

So I started my work with Python. Though Python was good and simple to write, I found that if I really want to use some computationally heavy algorithms in future, it'll slow down my neural network.

Though I am not planning to use this neural network for some real work or big project. I still want to make it perfect. *( I'll try my best )*

So I was left with Java. 

*Ughh*

Though fast, Java is now getting old. I need to write so many lines for doing simple stuff. And this is really tiring. I still love Java but this language is simply not suitable for creating neural networks. <br>
*That's just my opinion*

Then I realised, only thing I was left to use was JavaScipt. 

On this, I won't comment anything. JavaScript is gooood, but again, it's not made for doing things faster and efficiently. 

## So I picked up GO!

The language which is easy to learn as python (I found it was really easy to learn) and as fast as C. 

What more can you ask for? 

I guess Go stands for *Gold* ! It's really a piece of Gold.

Fast, efficient and easy to pickup. 
Though I just picked it up, I was able to a lot of things with it. Just two hours after deciding to use 'Go' for this fun project of mine, I am already done with the basic Matrix Math Library. 

I don't know when I'll finish the original project of creating a neural network from scratch. But I'll try to learn things and code them as I move ahead.

I'll be updating my experience with Go as I learn more. Till now, I'll really recommend using Go for your projects. 

In future, I am planning to use it in my WebDev projects too. 

Bye.
