synopsis: A new beginning, a new start. A new me? Maybe not, but I am trying to be better. I am trying to be more consistent and more productive.

So hey there, I am writing after a long time. To be exact, last time, I wrote on this blog in 2022 (4 years ago). So a long time has passed and many new things have happened in my life since then, so I thought about writing this update post.

I am now doing my masters in physics and I am loving it. I am learning so many new things and I am loving every bit of it. I have also started doing research in physics and it's really fun. I am learning a lot and I am really enjoying it. This is something I always wanted to do and I am really happy that I am doing it now.

No one actually reads this blog but I am writing here to let out my thoughts? I don't have many people with whom I can share my thoughts so I will write them down here? Moreover I will try to start writing something more technical as well. I have been writing only random stuff for a long time but I will try to write something technical as well.

This can be physics or maybe something related to programming. I am not sure yet but I'll try to write something interesting.

See you in the next post.
